Harry Kane has been nominated for the union’s player of the year trophy, Dele Alli is on the shortlist for the young player award and four Tottenham players are in the PFA’s team of the season – Kane, Alli, Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose.<span style="line-height: 1.42857;">The dinner will be held at London’s Grosvenor House hotel but Pochettino’s thoughts are fixed on Monday night’s West Brom game, in which Tottenham will attempt to increase the pressure on Leicester City. They sit five points behind the Premier League leaders with four matches to play. Leicester face Swansea City at home on Sunday afternoon. Tottenham v West Bromwich Albion: match preview Pochettino was asked where his players would be on Sunday night, when the dinner was taking place. “At home. At home. At home!” he said. “But this is normal and all people can understand. It’s a shame but we play Monday. “It’s true that the players would like to go but I think the responsibility when you have a big game for us like West Brom on Monday – you need to stay at home, rest and focus on the game. After the game on Monday, we have time for a party or to congratulate the players – for everything!” Pochettino is hoping that Leicester drop points against Swansea and when he discussed the impact of the suspension of Jame Vardy, Leicester’s top scorer, it was possible to wonder whether he was making an attempt at mind games for the first time during the run-in. Vardy is banned after his sending-off in last Sunday’s 2-2 home draw with West Ham United. “I think that it’s a big impact for Leicester because Vardy is one of the best players in the Premier League,” Pochettino said. “Sure, it’s a big impact for them. I think Leicester have very good players and are in a position that they deserve to be in, nobody gave them nothing for nothing. But he’s one of the best strikers in the Premier League. They will feel that, but I’m sure they have different players that can play the same way.”</span></p>', '', '', '', '', 2, '', '', 3, 'sport', 'sport', 0, '2016-04-23 16:09:42', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, 0),

But while impeachment is not uncommon, not every country agrees on what it means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lawmakers in at least a half-dozen countries, from Iran to the United States, have subjected their leaders to impeachment in recent decades. And not every case turned out badly for the politician who was targeted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the United States, two presidents have been impeached &mdash; Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998 &mdash; but the rules required neither to step aside during their trials. Both were acquitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in Brazil, Ms. Rousseff has not yet been impeached, legal scholars say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In Brazil, the term impeachment is used only after a conviction is made in the trial,&rdquo; said Daniel Vargas, a law professor at Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that Brazil&rsquo;s Senate voted against her on Thursday, Ms. Rousseff will have to step aside during her impeachment trial, which could last for six months.

His response was, in essence, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Set up an official commission that could study this question,&rdquo; Pope Francis mused out loud, the ANSA news agency reported. &ldquo;I think, yes. It would be good for the church to clarify this point. I agree. I will do something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ANSA also reported that the pope appeared uncertain about the actual role that women deacons had in the first years of the church, and whether they were ordained or not. A commission could help clarify such issues, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deacons are ordained ministers in the Roman Catholic Church, and in many parishes they perform many of the roles entrusted to priests. They are permitted to preach at Mass, baptize, witness marriages and conduct funeral services. They must be men over the age of 35, and they may be married (though if a deacon&rsquo;s wife dies, he is expected to remain celibate).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church in the United States has been actively encouraging men to become deacons to assist priests stretched thin because of a shortage of priests. The&nbsp;<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_states_conference_of_catholic_bishops/index.html?inline=nyt-org">United States Conference of Catholic Bishops</a>&nbsp;says there are now more than 13,000 men serving in what is called the &ldquo;permanent diaconate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not the first time the issue of female deacons has come up. In 1995, an American group of canon law experts&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/12/us/expert-panel-on-catholic-church-law-backs-women-as-deacons.html">said that&nbsp;</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/12/us/expert-panel-on-catholic-church-law-backs-women-as-deacons.html">ordaining women as deacons in the church</a>&nbsp;would be in keeping with Catholic theology and past practice, though the Vatican never acted on that recommendation. The topic has continued to come up in discussions, however: Just last week, for example, scholars met at the University of Toronto for a&nbsp;<a href="https://stmikes.utoronto.ca/event/women-the-diaconate-and-the-future-of-ministry-a-study-day-at-the-faculty-of-theology/">conference</a>entitled: &ldquo;Women, the Diaconate, and the Future of Ministry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Groups who have pushed for women to play a greater role in the church welcomed the pope&rsquo;s declarations, as an important &mdash; if embryonic &mdash; step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rev. James Bretzke, a professor of theology at Boston College, said in a statement, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t underscore enough how groundbreaking this is for the Church.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Father Bretzke, who, like Pope Francis, is a member of the Jesuit religious order, added, &ldquo;If women can be ordained as deacons, then this is going to weaken &mdash; not destroy &mdash; but weaken significantly the argument that women absolutely are incapable of being ordained as priests. So this is opening more than a crack in the door.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Women&rsquo;s Ordination Conference, an American organization that supports the ordination of women as deacons, priests and bishops, said in a statement: &ldquo;Opening a commission to study the diaconate for women would be a great step for the Vatican in recognizing its own history.&rdquo;</p>\r\n', 'public/site/images/1/46456456.jpg', '', 'The off-the-cuff remark was far from a change in doctrine, but opened a conversation on a pressing issue.', '', 0, 0, '', 1, 'world', 'world', 9, '2016-05-12 16:26:06', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, 0);
